# LJIT2RPi
LuaJIT FFI Interop to Raspberry Pi

Provides basic access to various Raspberry Pi libraries.

The Raspberry Pi is basically a Linux machine, with some specialized libraries.  Gaining access to the core Linux routines is best
achieved by using the ljsyscall project.

This project contains an earlier version of ljsyscall, as well as wrappers for the Pi specific libraries, particularly
related to low level graphics.
